## Content

Among the types of content I record, there are three main categories that are most important: routine meetings and work diaries, task notes, and card notes.

**Routine meetings and work diary notes** include a meeting section (including daily records and technical support), a today's section containing plans, completed work and ongoing work, next steps, and to-do items. It has a dedicated note structure, which I will share later.

**Task notes** are records of each task, and the note structure consists of various recording methods and structures depending on the task. However, elements such as background (context), resources, and history will certainly be included. [[2024-09-02-template-Obsidian-action-add History]]

**Card notes**: I have only recently started taking card notes. In the past, I used to record card notes with different structures. However, recently, in combination with AI tools, I have designed a relatively stable note structure standard. It allows me to create new card notes quickly, which I will discuss later.
